in terminal navigate using `cd` (i hope you know how to navigate
a terminal) to '.\website' and run

```
python -m venv env
```

```
env\Scripts\activate
```

you should see the (env) header before the terminal 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then 

```
python run.py
```

will start the server
